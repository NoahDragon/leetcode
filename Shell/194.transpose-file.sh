# Testcase Example:  'a'
#
# Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content.
# 
# You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is
# separated by the ' ' character.
# 
# 
# For example, if file.txt has the following content:
# 
# name age
# alice 21
# ryan 30
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Output the following:
# 
# name alice ryan
# age 21 30
# 
# 
#
# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.
