 *
 * Design and implement a TwoSum class. It should support the following
 * operations: add and find.
 * 
 * 
 * add - Add the number to an internal data structure.
 * find - Find if there exists any pair of numbers which sum is equal to the
 * value.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * add(1); add(3); add(5);
 * find(4) -> true
 * find(7) -> false
