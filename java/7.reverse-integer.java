 *
 * Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: 123
 * Output:  321
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 *

 * Note:
 * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers
 * within the 32-bit signed integer range. For the purpose of this problem,
 * assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
