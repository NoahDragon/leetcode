 * Testcase Example:  '"X"\n"L"'
 *
 * In a string composed of 'L', 'R', and 'X' characters, like "RXXLRXRXL", a
 * move consists of either replacing one occurrence of "XL" with "LX", or
 * replacing one occurrence of "RX" with "XR". Given the starting string start
 * and the ending string end, return True if and only if there exists a
 * sequence of moves to transform one string to the other.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: start = "RXXLRXRXL", end = "XRLXXRRLX"
 * Output: True
 * Explanation:
 * We can transform start to end following these steps:
 * RXXLRXRXL ->
 * XRXLRXRXL ->
 * XRLXRXRXL ->
 * XRLXXRRXL ->
 * XRLXXRRLX
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= len(start) = len(end) <= 10000.
 * Both start and end will only consist of characters in {'L', 'R', 'X'}.
