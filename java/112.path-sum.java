 *
 * Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path
 * such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
 * 
 * For example:
 * Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠             5
 * ⁠            / \
 * ⁠           4   8
 * ⁠          /   / \
 * ⁠         11  13  4
 * ⁠        /  \      \
 * ⁠       7    2      1
 * 
 * 
 * return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
