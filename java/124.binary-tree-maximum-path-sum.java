 * 
 * Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 * 
 * 
 * For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some
 * starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.
 * The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the
 * root.
 * 
 * 
 * For example:
 * Given the below binary tree,
 * 
 * ⁠      1
 * ⁠     / \
 * ⁠    2   3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Return 6.
