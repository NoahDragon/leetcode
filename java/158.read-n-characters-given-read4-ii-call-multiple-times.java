 * The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it
 * returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n)
 * that reads n characters from the file.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * The read function may be called multiple times.
