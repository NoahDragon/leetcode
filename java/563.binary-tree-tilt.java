 *
 * Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.
 * 
 * The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the
 * sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node
 * values. Null node has tilt 0.
 * 
 * The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * ⁠        1
 * ⁠      /   \
 * ⁠     2     3
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: 
 * Tilt of node 2 : 0
 * Tilt of node 3 : 0
 * Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
 * Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The sum of node values in any subtree won't exceed the range of 32-bit
 * integer. 
 * All the tilt values won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.
