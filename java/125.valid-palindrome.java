 * 
 * Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only
 * alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For example,
 * "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
 * "race a car" is not a palindrome.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to
 * ask during an interview.
 * 
 * For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
