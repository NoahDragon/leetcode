 *
 * This is a follow up of Shortest Word Distance. The only difference is now
 * you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly
 * many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?
 * 
 * Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and
 * implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the
 * shortest distance between these two words in the list.
 * 
 * For example,
 * Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3.
 * Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are
 * both in the list.
