 * Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average
 * of all integers in the sliding window.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
 * m.next(1) = 1
 * m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
 * m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
 * m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
