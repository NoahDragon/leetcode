# 
# The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.
# 
# 
# +----------+-------------+
# |  Number  |  Frequency  |
# +----------+-------------|
# |  0       |  7          |
# |  1       |  1          |
# |  2       |  3          |
# |  3       |  1          |
# +----------+-------------+
# 
# 
# In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the
# median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

# Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as
# median.
