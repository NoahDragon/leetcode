 *
 * 
 * Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is
 * a palindrome.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, given s = "aab",
 * Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced
 * using 1 cut.
