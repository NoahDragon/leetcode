 * Note: This is an extension of House Robber.
 * 
 * After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new
 * place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This
 * time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the
 * first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system
 * for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street. 
 * 
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of
 * each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight
 * without alerting the police.
 * 
 * Credits:Special thanks to @Freezen for adding this problem and creating all
 * test cases.
