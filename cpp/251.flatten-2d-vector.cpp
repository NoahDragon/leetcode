 * 
 * Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.
 * 
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given 2d vector = 
 * 
 * [
 * ⁠ [1,2],
 * ⁠ [3],
 * ⁠ [4,5,6]
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of
 * elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5,6].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * As an added challenge, try to code it using only iterators in C++ or
 * iterators in Java.
