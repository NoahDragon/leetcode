# Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as
# a sequence of non-space characters.
# 
# 
# 
# The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words
# are always separated by a single space.
# 
# 
# 
# For example,
# Given s = "the sky is blue",
# return "blue is sky the".
# 
# 
# 
# Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
