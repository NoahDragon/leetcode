#
# The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which
# the corresponding bits are different.
# 
# Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the
# given numbers.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: 4, 14, 2
# 
# Output: 6
# 
# Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is
# 0010 (just
# showing the four bits relevant in this case). So the answer will be:
# HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 +
# 2 + 2 = 6.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# Elements of the given array are in the range of 0  to 10^9
# Length of the array will not exceed 10^4.
