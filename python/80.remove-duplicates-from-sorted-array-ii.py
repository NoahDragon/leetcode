# Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":
# What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?
# 
# 
# For example,
# Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
# 
# 
# Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums
# being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new
# length.
