 * Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as
 * a sequence of non-space characters.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words
 * are always separated by a single space.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given s = "the sky is blue",
 * return "blue is sky the".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
