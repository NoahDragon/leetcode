 *
 * Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree
 * (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.
 * Note:
 * A subtree must include all of its descendants.
 * Here's an example:
 * 
 * ⁠   10
 * ⁠   / \
 * ⁠  5  15
 * ⁠ / \   \ 
 * ⁠1   8   7
 * 
 * The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one. 
 * The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?
