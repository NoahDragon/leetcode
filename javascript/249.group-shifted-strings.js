 *
 * Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter,
 * for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep "shifting" which forms the
 * sequence:
 * "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"
 * 
 * Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all
 * strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.
 * 
 * For example, given: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"], 
 * A solution is:
 * 
 * [
 * ⁠ ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
 * ⁠ ["az","ba"],
 * ⁠ ["acef"],
 * ⁠ ["a","z"]
 * ]
